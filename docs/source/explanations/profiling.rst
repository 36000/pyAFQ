Profiling
=========
Once the bundles are identified, pyAFQ quantifies various properties of the
tract along its length. By default, these are fractional anisotropy and
mean diffusivity from diffusion tensor imaging. However, custom tissue
properties may be provided (see :ref:`custom-scalars` for details)
and there are a variety of other built-in tissue properties that you
can find in :ref:`methods_docs`.
