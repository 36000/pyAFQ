              connections in a group of children with a wide range of reading
              abilities. We segmented the callosal fibers into regions based on
              their likely cortical projection zones, and we measured diffusion
              properties in these segmented regions. Phonological awareness (a
              key factor in reading acquisition) was positively correlated with
              diffusivity perpendicular to the main axis of the callosal fibers
              that connect the temporal lobes. These results could be explained
              by several physiological properties. For example, good readers may
              have fewer but larger axons connecting left and right temporal
              lobes, or their axon membranes in these regions may be more
              permeable than the membranes of poor readers. These measurements
              are consistent with previous work suggesting that good readers

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Individuals with persistent developmental
               stuttering display deficits in aligning motor actions to
               external cues (i.e., sensorimotor synchronization). Diffusion
               imaging studies point to stuttering-associated differences in
               dorsal, not ventral, white matter pathways, and in the
               cerebellar peduncles. Here, we studied microstructural white
               matter differences between adults who stutter (AWS) and fluent
               speakers using two complementary approaches to: (a) assess
               previously reported group differences in white matter
               diffusivity, and (b) evaluate the relationship between white
               matter diffusivity and sensorimotor synchronization in each
               group. METHODS: Participants completed a sensorimotor
               synchronization task and a diffusion MRI scan. We identified the
               cerebellar peduncles and major dorsal- and ventral-stream
               language pathways in each individual and assessed correlations
               between sensorimotor synchronization and diffusion measures
               along the tracts. RESULTS: The results demonstrated group
               differences in dorsal, not ventral, language tracts, in
               alignment with prior reports. Specifically, AWS had
               significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left
               arcuate fasciculus, and significantly higher mean diffusivity
               (MD) in the bilateral frontal aslant tract compared to fluent
               speakers, while no significant group difference was detected in
               the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. We also found
               significant group differences in both FA and MD of the left
               middle cerebellar peduncle. Comparing patterns of association
               with sensorimotor synchronization revealed a novel double
               dissociation: MD within the left inferior cerebellar peduncle
               was significantly correlated with mean asynchrony in AWS but not
               in fluent speakers, while FA within the left arcuate fasciculus
               was significantly correlated with mean asynchrony in fluent
               speakers, but not in AWS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the
               view that stuttering involves altered connectivity in dorsal
               tracts and that AWS may rely more heavily on cerebellar tracts
               to process timing information. Evaluating microstructural
               associations with sensitive behavioral measures provides a
               powerful tool for discovering additional functional differences
               in the underlying connectivity in AWS.",

They also motivate the need for fully automatic algorithms for finding white matter bundles. One popular algorithm, Automated Fiber Quantification (AFQ), has been shown to be reliable for analyzing a suite of large bundles. Here, we demonstrate that this approach can be extended to a relatively small white matter bundle, the optic tract. We develop an automated method that finds a portion of this bundle automatically. We compare the automatically found optic tract to optic tracts previously found using an algorithm that requires expert intervention, and find high degree of overlap. While previous methods work well in high-quality data, we demonstrate that the novel method proposed here generalizes broadly in subjects from three different datasets with differing data quality and a broad age range. Finally, we describe how this approach could be easily extended to other small bundles.",

              important factor underlying many cognitive and neurological
              disorders. In vivo, tissue properties may vary systematically
              along each tract for several reasons: different populations of
              axons enter and exit the tract, and disease can strike at local
              positions within the tract. Hence quantifying and understanding
              diffusion measures along each fiber tract (Tract Profile) may
              reveal new insights into white matter development, function, and
              disease that are not obvious from mean measures of that tract. We

              the brains of typically developing children and children at risk
              for white matter injury secondary to preterm birth. First,
              fractional anisotropy (FA) values vary substantially within a
              tract but the Tract FA Profile is consistent across subjects.
              Thus, Tract Profiles contain far more information than mean
              diffusion measures. Second, developmental changes in FA occur at
              specific positions within the Tract Profile, rather than along
              the entire tract. Third, Tract Profiles can be used to compare
              white matter properties of individual patients to standardized
              Tract Profiles of a healthy population to elucidate unique
              features of that patient's clinical condition. Fourth, Tract
              Profiles can be used to evaluate the association between white
              matter properties and behavioral outcomes. Specifically, in the

              leverages latest state-of-the-art streamline-based registration
              and clustering to recognize and extract bundles using prior
              bundle models. RecoBundles uses bundle models as shape priors for
              detecting similar streamlines and bundles in tractograms.
              RecoBundles is 100\% streamline-based, is efficient to work with

  abstract  = "The ability of fiber tractography to delineate non-invasively
               the white matter fiber pathways of the brain raises
               possibilities for clinical applications and offers enormous
               potential for neuroscience. In the last decade, fiber tracking
               has become the method of choice to investigate quantitative MRI
               parameters in specific bundles of white matter. For
               neurosurgeons, it is quickly becoming an invaluable tool for the
               planning of surgery, allowing for visualization and localization
               of important white matter pathways before and even during
               surgery. Fiber tracking has also claimed a central role in the
               field of ``connectomics,'' a technique that builds and studies
               comprehensive maps of the complex network of connections within
               the brain, and to which significant resources have been
               allocated worldwide. Despite its unique abilities and exciting
               applications, fiber tracking is not without controversy, in
               particular when it comes to its interpretation. As
               neuroscientists are eager to study the brain's connectivity, the
               quantification of tractography-derived ``connection strengths''
               between distant brain regions is becoming increasingly popular.
               However, this practice is often frowned upon by fiber-tracking
               experts. In light of this controversy, this paper provides an
               overview of the key concepts of tractography, the technical
               considerations at play, and the different types of tractography
               algorithm, as well as the common misconceptions and mistakes
               that surround them. We also highlight the ongoing challenges
               related to fiber tracking. While recent methodological
               developments have vastly increased the biological accuracy of
               fiber tractograms, one should be aware that, even with
               state-of-the-art techniques, many issues that severely bias the
               resulting structural ``connectomes'' remain unresolved.",

  abstract  = "Mapping tissue microstructure with MRI holds great promise as a
               noninvasive window into tissue organization at the cellular
               level. Having originated within the realm of diffusion NMR in
               the late 1970s, this field is experiencing an exponential growth
               in the number of publications. At the same time, model-based
               approaches are also increasingly incorporated into advanced MRI
               acquisition and reconstruction techniques. However, after about
               two decades of intellectual and financial investment,
               microstructural mapping has yet to find a single commonly
               accepted clinical application. Here, we suggest that slow
               progress in clinical translation may signify unresolved
               fundamental problems. We outline such problems and related
               practical pitfalls, as well as review strategies for developing
               and validating tissue microstructure models, to provoke a
               discussion on how to bridge the gap between our scientific
               aspirations and the clinical reality. We argue for recalibrating
               the efforts of our community toward a more systematic focus on
               fundamental research aimed at identifying relevant degrees of
               freedom affecting the measured MR signal. Such a focus is
               essential for realizing the truly revolutionary potential of
               noninvasive three-dimensional in vivo microstructural mapping.",

              tractography robust to partial volume effects, we automatically
              dissected 50 white matter (WM) fascicles. These fascicles connect
              deep nuclei (thalamus, putamen, pallidum) to different cortical
              functional areas (associative, motor, sensorimotor, limbic),
              basal forebrain and substantia nigra. Then, among these 50
              candidate WM fascicles, only the ones that passed a test-retest
              reproducibility procedure qualified for further tractometry
              analysis. Leveraging the unique 2-timepoints test-retest
              Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset of over
              600 subjects, we found statistically significant differences in

              of the nigro-subthalamo-putaminal-thalamo-cortical pathway. This

              coordination of motor output. Detailed and quantifiable knowledge
              on WM fascicles in these areas is thus essential to improve the
